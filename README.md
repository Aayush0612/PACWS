# PACWS
A blazingly fast, light and minimalistic Point and Click Web-Scraper Extension for data and code.

To add to your suite of extensions in chrome(support for more browsers coming soon), simply go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer mode. Then click on Load unpacked and select the folder where you have downloaded PACWS.

Its that simple. Everything else is pretty self-explanatory. All the best on your scraping journey!
